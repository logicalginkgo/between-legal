  ## 1. Introduction

  Between ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of our
  users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your
  information when you use the Between app (the "App").

  ## 2. Information We Collect

  ### Information You Provide
  - **Account Information:** Email address and display name when you register.
  - **Partner Connection:** Your partner code and partner pairing information.
  - **User Content:** Photos, memory pin titles and notes, letters, and calendar
  events you create within the App.

  ### Information Collected Automatically
  - **Location Data:** Your device location is used to place memory pins on the
  shared map and calculate letter delivery times. Location data is only collected
  when you actively use the App and have granted permission.
  - **Device Information:** Basic device identifiers for authentication and
  service delivery.

  ### Information From Third Parties
  - **Authentication:** We use Supabase for authentication. When you sign in, we
  receive your authentication token and basic profile information.

  receive subscription status information but not your payment details.

  ## 3. How We Use Your Information

  We use your information solely to:
  - Provide and maintain the App's features (shared map, letters, calendar)
  - Authenticate your account and pair you with your partner
  - Store and display your photos and memory pins
  - Calculate and display letter delivery progress
  - Process and manage Between+ subscriptions
  - Respond to support requests and reports

  ## 4. Data Storage and Security

  - **Storage:** Your data is stored securely using Supabase, which uses
  industry-standard encryption and security practices.
  - **Photos:** Photos you upload are stored in secure cloud storage and are only
  accessible to you and your connected partner.
  - **Encryption:** Data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL.

  ## 5. Data Sharing

  We do **not**:
  - Sell your personal information to third parties
  - Share your photos, letters, or notes with anyone outside your partnership
  - Use your content for advertising purposes
  - Share data with data brokers

  We **may** share your information:
  - With your connected partner (this is the core function of the App)
  - When required by law or valid legal process
  - To protect the safety of our users or the public

  ## 6. Your Rights

  You have the right to:
  - **Access** your personal data stored in the App
  - **Delete** your account and associated data
  - **Revoke** device permissions (camera, photos, location) at any time through
  your device settings
  - **Unpair** from your partner, which stops data sharing between accounts

  ## 7. Device Permissions

  The App requests the following permissions:
  - **Camera:** To take photos for memory pins
  - **Photo Library:** To select existing photos for memory pins
  - **Location:** To place pins on the map and calculate letter delivery times

  All permissions are optional and can be revoked in your device's Settings app at
   any time. Some App features may be limited without these permissions.

  ## 8. Data Retention

  - Your data is retained as long as your account is active.
  - If you delete your account, your personal data will be removed from our
  servers.
  - Content shared within a partnership (pins, letters) may persist for your
  partner until they also delete their account.

  ## 9. Children's Privacy

  The App is not intended for children under the age of 17. We do not knowingly
  collect personal information from children under 17. If we learn that we have
  collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.

  ## 10. Content Reporting

  Users can report content they believe violates our Terms of Service. Reports are
   reviewed and appropriate action is taken, which may include content removal and
   account suspension.

  ## 11. Changes to This Policy

  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
  significant changes through the App or via email. Your continued use of the App
  after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
